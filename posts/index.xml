Welcome to the new blog page.
Some of you may have already stumbled across the site on Twitter or on Telegram in the last update announcement, but now here again officially!
Built with the fast and beautiful Static Site Generator Hugo and the LoveIt Theme, this site can keep up with WordPress and even outperform it.
What changes for all blog readers? Well, actually nothing. The only thing that changes is the URL (at least for now) instead of mailcow.</description></item><item><title>‚òÄÔ∏èüêÑ Mooly Update 2022 - TFA Flow Update | Changelog</title><link>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 08:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-07/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!

TFA Changes 2FA is now also possible for mailbox users in the UI (previously this was reserved for administrators). Also, it is now possible to enable multiple 2FA options for an account.

Yesterday we received an important tip about a critical security vulnerability in mailcow (thanks again for that). It affects IMAPSYNC and gives access to administration rights in the mailcow UI and API.
It is strongly recommended to install the update as soon as possible to prevent exploitation.
As always please take a look at the GitHub Release: https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2022-05d The update does not remove any important functionality from mailcow or IMAPSYNC!</description></item><item><title>üååüêÆ Mooay 2022 Update - The Tag Update | Revision C - Changelog</title><link>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 09:22:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05/</guid><description>2022-05c It¬¥s us again again!
This time we¬¥ve published the 2022-05c Update which is a very small one.

During the same day we received a message that SOGo would not work since the update, more precisely the login.
So we released an update yesterday evening around 23:00 (German summertime) which solves this problem in most cases.
Please update your mailcow via the update.sh Script as soon as possible to use SOGo as usual again.</description></item><item><title>üêÑüê∞Moopril 2022 - ClamAV, Rspamd, SOGo Update | Patchnotes</title><link>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-04/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 10:42:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-04/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!

We have released an impromptu bug fix update that fixes a few minor bugs and graphical issues.
These are only minor changes this time, but as the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;Every little bit helps&amp;rdquo;.
We have moved the version footer back to the correct position. Faithful to the motto: Stay were you are! We have improved the release tag handling with the version footer. The backup and restore script now uses Debian Bullseye instead of Buster.</description></item><item><title>üêÑüíÆ Moorch Update 2022 ‚Äì ClamAV, Dovecot &amp; Olefy Update | Patchnotes</title><link>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-03/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 16:48:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-03/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone, March is here and by the end of the month it will be spring again.
