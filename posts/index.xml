A small but important update for or against the current SOGo Sieve/mail sending problems is here!
We received countless messages about this and implemented a fix within tis update, which hopefully solves the problem for everyone.
For those who are interested: It&amp;rsquo;s probably related to the IPv6 support introduced in SOGo 5.7.1 and the internal IPv6 connectivity of mailcow¬¥s Docker containers, which triggered connectivity issues with SOGo.
Yeah&amp;hellip; however, this bug should be fixed now.</description></item><item><title>Our new addition: The new mailcow UI (MUH-I) in Bootstrap 5</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</guid><description>It took long enough, but here it is finally: The new mailcow UI!
Currently it&amp;rsquo;s still exclusively in the nightly builds because we want to optimize the UI.
And that&amp;rsquo;s where you come in! Because we want to make the UI as user friendly as possible and improve not only the framework but also the usability.
So if there was one thing that always bothered you so far, please let us know!</description></item><item><title>üåäüêÑ Amoogust Update 2022 - The Nightly Build Switch Update | Changes</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 10:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!

Welcome to the new blog page.
Some of you may have already stumbled across the site on Twitter or on Telegram in the last update announcement, but now here again officially!
Built with the fast and beautiful Static Site Generator Hugo and the LoveIt Theme, this site can keep up with WordPress and even outperform it.
What changes for all blog readers? Well, actually nothing. The only thing that changes is the URL (at least for now) instead of mailcow.</description></item><item><title>‚òÄÔ∏èüêÑ Mooly Update 2022 - TFA Flow Update | Changelog</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 08:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-07/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!

Yesterday we received an important tip about a critical security vulnerability in mailcow (thanks again for that). It affects IMAPSYNC and gives access to administration rights in the mailcow UI and API.
It is strongly recommended to install the update as soon as possible to prevent exploitation.
As always please take a look at the GitHub Release: https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2022-05d The update does not remove any important functionality from mailcow or IMAPSYNC!</description></item><item><title>üååüêÆ Mooay 2022 Update - The Tag Update | Revision C - Changelog</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 09:22:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05/</guid><description>2022-05c It¬¥s us again again!
