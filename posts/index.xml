<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve fixed the wrongly used clamav tag inside the docker-compose.yml. Now you are really using ClamAV 1.0.3 LTS!</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve removed the restart action from the <code>depends_on</code> section (tied to the unbound healthcheck logic) from the docker-compose.yml. Older Versions of Docker Compose v2 would not be able to start the stack with those settings set. (Please keep your systems up to date!!!!)</li>

With the Nightly Branch, it is now possible to use an external Identity Provider as an additional authentication source.
mailcow utilizes the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol to authenticate only mailbox users.
To enable this, we have made some changes to the way authentication works.
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what has changed, what we had in mind, and what we plan to add in the future. Of course, we will also show you how to use the new feature.</description></item><item><title>üí™üêÆ6Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ mailcow: dockerized (ARM64) is now in open Beta (inside nightly builds)</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-open-beta/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-open-beta/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>

I hope you are not tired yet of performing updates.
The 2023-08 Release is here, and it contains some hotfixes for the new Spamhaus DQS feature.
If you are not using Spamhaus DQS and haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced any issues with the 2023-07 update, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to install this update.
As this release only contains hotfixes, there is not much to say about it, except for one thing.</description></item><item><title>üçí üêÑ Mooly Update 2023 (a) - Manageable CORS Settings and UI Improvements</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-07/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 10:48:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Patrick Schult/FreddleSpl0it</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-07/</guid><description>2023-07a (Release 31th July 2023) There are some fixes for the 2023-07 update.

It has been more than a month since you heard from us and today we have a shadowdrop as an update.
Since we have a few things to discuss and want to communicate directly in the future, we came up with a section called What&amp;rsquo;s up?.
Today we start with the first topic, namely ARM64:
Originally we announced to have mailcow ARM64 ready by June 2023. Obviously that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out so well.</description></item><item><title>üõëüìú Spamhaus DNS Blocklist changes since 2023-07</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/spamhaus-dnsblocklist/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 16:00:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/spamhaus-dnsblocklist/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>
