In this context, you may request to be informed about the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 DSGVO in connection with the transfer.</li></ul><h5 id=2-right-to-rectification class=heading-element><a href=#2-right-to-rectification class=heading-mark></a>2. Right to rectification</h5><p>You have a right to rectification and/or completion vis-à-vis the controller if the personal data processed concerning you is inaccurate or incomplete. The controller shall carry out the rectification without undue delay.</p><h5 id=3-right-to-restriction-of-processing class=heading-element><a href=#3-right-to-restriction-of-processing class=heading-mark></a>3. Right to restriction of processing</h5><p>You may request the restriction of the processing of personal data concerning you under the following conditions:</p><ul><li>(1) if you contest the accuracy of the personal data concerning you for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;</li><li>(2) the processing is unlawful and you object to the erasure of the personal data and request instead the restriction of the use of the personal data;</li><li>(3) the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you need it for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or</li><li>(4) if you have objected to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and it is not yet clear whether the controller&rsquo;s legitimate grounds override your grounds.
If the processing of personal data concerning you has been restricted, such data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or a Member State.
If the restriction of processing has been restricted in accordance with the above conditions, you will be informed by the controller before the restriction is lifted.</li></ul><h5 id=4-right-to-deletion class=heading-element><a href=#4-right-to-deletion class=heading-mark></a>4. Right to deletion</h5><p>a) Obligation to delete
You may request the controller to erase the personal data concerning you without undue delay, and the controller is obliged to erase such data without undue delay, if one of the following reasons applies:</p><ul><li>(1) The personal data concerning you are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.</li><li>(2) You revoke your consent on which the processing was based pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) or Art. 9(2)(a) DSGVO and there is no other legal basis for the processing.</li><li>(3) You object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (2) DSGVO.</li><li>(4) The personal data concerning you have been processed unlawfully.</li><li>(5) The erasure of the personal data concerning you is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.</li><li>(6) The personal data concerning you has been collected in relation to information society services offered pursuant to Article 8(1) DSGVO.
b) Information to third parties
If the controller has made the personal data concerning you public and is obliged to erase it pursuant to Article 17(1) of the GDPR, it shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, having regard to the available technology and the cost of implementation, to inform data controllers that process the personal data that you, as the data subject, have requested them to erase all links to or copies or replications of such personal data.
c) Exceptions
The right to erasure does not exist to the extent that the processing is necessary</li><li>(1) for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information;</li><li>(2) for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;</li><li>(3) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health pursuant to Article 9(2)(h) and (i) and Article 9(3) of the GDPR;</li><li>(4) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) DSGVO, insofar as the right referred to in section a) is likely to render impossible or seriously prejudice the achievement of the purposes of such processing; or</li><li>(5) for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li></ul><h5 id=5-right-to-information class=heading-element><a href=#5-right-to-information class=heading-mark></a>5. Right to information</h5><p>If you have asserted the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing against the controller, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of this rectification or erasure of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
You have the right against the controller to be informed about these recipients.</p><h5 id=6-right-to-data-portability class=heading-element><a href=#6-right-to-data-portability class=heading-mark></a>6. Right to data portability</h5><p>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided to the controller in a structured, common and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transfer this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to whom the personal data was provided, provided that.</p><ul><li>(1) the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO or Art. 9(2)(a) DSGVO or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6(1)(b) DSGVO and</li><li>(2) the processing is carried out with the help of automated procedures.
In exercising this right, you also have the right to obtain that the personal data concerning you be transferred directly from one controller to another controller, insofar as this is technically feasible. Freedoms and rights of other persons must not be affected by this.
The right to data portability does not apply to processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</li></ul><h5 id=7-right-of-objection class=heading-element><a href=#7-right-of-objection class=heading-mark></a>7. Right of objection</h5><p>You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) DSGVO; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
The controller shall no longer process the personal data concerning you unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
If the personal data concerning you is processed for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to processing of the personal data concerning you for the purposes of such marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.
If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for these purposes.
You have the possibility, in connection with the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to exercise your right to object by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.</p><h5 id=8-right-to-revoke-the-declaration-of-consent-under-data-protection-law class=heading-element><a href=#8-right-to-revoke-the-declaration-of-consent-under-data-protection-law class=heading-mark></a>8. Right to revoke the declaration of consent under data protection law</h5><p>You have the right to revoke your declaration of consent under data protection law at any time. The revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.</p><h5 id=9-automated-decision-in-individual-cases-including-profiling class=heading-element><a href=#9-automated-decision-in-individual-cases-including-profiling class=heading-mark></a>9. Automated decision in individual cases including profiling</h5><p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing - including profiling - which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This does not apply if the decision</p><ul><li>(1) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between you and the controller,</li><li>(2) is permitted by legal provisions of the Union or the Member States to which the controller is subject and these legal provisions contain appropriate measures to protect your rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests; or</li><li>(3) is made with your express consent.
However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Article 9(1) of the GDPR, unless Article 9(2)(a) or (g) applies and appropriate measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests.
With regard to the cases mentioned in (1) and (3), the controller shall take reasonable steps to safeguard the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests, which include, at a minimum, the right to obtain the intervention of a person on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.</li></ul><h5 id=10-right-to-complain-to-a-supervisory-authority class=heading-element><a href=#10-right-to-complain-to-a-supervisory-authority class=heading-mark></a>10.

The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Article 78 GDPR.</p><h5 id=11-contact-form class=heading-element><a href=#11-contact-form class=heading-mark></a>11.
