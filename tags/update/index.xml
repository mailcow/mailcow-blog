A small but important update for or against the current SOGo Sieve/mail sending problems is here!
We received countless messages about this and implemented a fix within tis update, which hopefully solves the problem for everyone.
For those who are interested: It&amp;rsquo;s probably related to the IPv6 support introduced in SOGo 5.7.1 and the internal IPv6 connectivity of mailcow´s Docker containers, which triggered connectivity issues with SOGo.
Yeah&amp;hellip; however, this bug should be fixed now.</description></item><item><title>🌊🐄 Amoogust Update 2022 - The Nightly Build Switch Update | Changes</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 10:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!

It&amp;rsquo;s update time once again, a little later than before (I&amp;rsquo;ll get into that a bit later) but still packed with some changes:

Yesterday we received an important tip about a critical security vulnerability in mailcow (thanks again for that). It affects IMAPSYNC and gives access to administration rights in the mailcow UI and API.
It is strongly recommended to install the update as soon as possible to prevent exploitation.
As always please take a look at the GitHub Release: https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2022-05d
The update does not remove any important functionality from mailcow or IMAPSYNC!</description></item><item><title>🌌🐮 Mooay 2022 Update - The Tag Update | Revision C - Changelog</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 09:22:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05/</guid><description>2022-05c It´s us again again!
