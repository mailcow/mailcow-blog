<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve fixed the wrongly used clamav tag inside the docker-compose.yml. Now you are really using ClamAV 1.0.3 LTS!</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve removed the restart action from the <code>depends_on</code> section (tied to the unbound healthcheck logic) from the docker-compose.yml. Older Versions of Docker Compose v2 would not be able to start the stack with those settings set. (Please keep your systems up to date!!!!)</li>

If you are not using Spamhaus DQS and haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced any issues with the 2023-07 update, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to install this update.

It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go:
Changelog For Dovecot, the maildir_very_dirty_syncs option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this. This describes the exact reasons for the performance boost as well as cases where the feature should be disabled: https://docs.</description></item><item><title>ü•öüêÑ Moopril Update 2023 - SOGo 5.8.2, Rspamd 3.5 and more | Revision A</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-04/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

The mailcow team is back with some exciting news about our beloved mailcow project!
But this time we are doing something a bit different than usual (at least here with the blog post entry)
As you may have noticed in the last few weeks, a new AI has been making the rounds on the Internet: ChatGPT.

To end the chaotic year 2022 in a worthy manner, the time has finally come. The long awaited Bootstrap 5 update is finally here!
As already mentioned in some posts, this update marks only the turning point of the mailcow UI, because the new base (Bootstrap 5) will offer us many new possibilities and scope for new features in the future.
Because of the Bootstrap update the old UI was completely renewed and ported to the new version.</description></item></channel></rss>
