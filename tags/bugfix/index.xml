A small but important update for or against the current SOGo Sieve/mail sending problems is here!
We received countless messages about this and implemented a fix within tis update, which hopefully solves the problem for everyone.
For those who are interested: It&amp;rsquo;s probably related to the IPv6 support introduced in SOGo 5.7.1 and the internal IPv6 connectivity of mailcow´s Docker containers, which triggered connectivity issues with SOGo.
Yeah&amp;hellip; however, this bug should be fixed now.</description></item><item><title>🌊🐄 Amoogust Update 2022 - The Nightly Build Switch Update | Changes</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 10:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>info@servercow.de (Moohoo)</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!

We&amp;rsquo;ve released an short update that improved the API and brings a new version of ClamAV (0.105.1).
Note: The update to ClamAV 0.105.1 is recommended by ClamAV as a security update (See ClamAV Update article)
Once again summarized what changes:

Automatic GitHub actions for building the latest container versions has been set up (currently not used productively).</description></item><item><title>☀️🐄 Mooly Update 2022 - TFA Flow Update | Changelog</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 08:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>info@servercow.de (Moohoo)</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-07/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!

TFA Changes 2FA is now also possible for mailbox users in the UI (previously this was reserved for administrators). Also, it is now possible to enable multiple 2FA options for an account.

We have released an impromptu bug fix update that fixes a few minor bugs and graphical issues.
These are only minor changes this time, but as the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;Every little bit helps&amp;rdquo;.
We have moved the version footer back to the correct position. Faithful to the motto: Stay were you are! We have improved the release tag handling with the version footer.

Today we are releasing the first hotfix for the 2022-01 Update.
This has changed:
Additions: We´ve added a Version Tag which is located at the bottom of the mailcow UI (It now shows the current release tag you are on!) Isn´t that crazy?

Due to the recent accidents regarding the Java library log4j we would like to inform you, that your mailcow is NOT affected directly by this.
Yes, it is true, that the Solr Container is a Java application which is affected by the log4j security breach. BUT solr is NOT accessible from the outside of the mailcow stack!
For those who are worried we released a Solr Hotfix which is fixing the log4j issue with the simple flag +EXTRA_ARGS+=('-Dlog4j2.</description></item><item><title>mailcows updated between 25th August and 2nd September 2021 should be updated again</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2021/rspamd_memleak_sep2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 20:19:57 +0100</pubDate><author>info@servercow.de (Moohoo)</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2021/rspamd_memleak_sep2021/</guid><description>Hi,
If you updated your mailcow between 25th August and 2nd September 2021 you most likely encounter a settings map memory leak in Rspamd that was fixed just now.
Besides that, we also heavily reduced the map hammering with another change in the map generator.
Update time!
