It&amp;rsquo;s update time once again, a little later than before (I&amp;rsquo;ll get into that a bit later) but still packed with some changes:
TFA Changes 2FA is now also possible for mailbox users in the UI (previously this was reserved for administrators). Also, it is now possible to enable multiple 2FA options for an account. Note: Only one is used, which is selected by the user. There is a nice new menu at to select the available 2FA options.</description></item><item><title>🌕🐄 Moone Update 2022 - The Docker Compose v2 Update (Part I) | Changes</title><link>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-06/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 12:07:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-06/</guid><description>Moohoo everybody!

We have released an impromptu bug fix update that fixes a few minor bugs and graphical issues.
These are only minor changes this time, but as the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;Every little bit helps&amp;rdquo;.
We have moved the version footer back to the correct position. Faithful to the motto: Stay were you are! We have improved the release tag handling with the version footer. The backup and restore script now uses Debian Bullseye instead of Buster.</description></item><item><title>🐄💮 Moorch Update 2022 – ClamAV, Dovecot &amp; Olefy Update | Patchnotes</title><link>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-03/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 16:48:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-03/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone, March is here and by the end of the month it will be spring again.

Today we are releasing the first hotfix for the 2022-01 Update.
This has changed:
Additions: We´ve added a Version Tag which is located at the bottom of the mailcow UI (It now shows the current release tag you are on!) Isn´t that crazy? (https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/pull/4437 ) Changes: The passwordless SOGo Authentication is now supporting calender invitations and calender/contact subscriptions (https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/pull/4439 ) The Autoreply Schedule for SOGo has been changed from 24h to 5m (https://github.</description></item><item><title>⚠️ Important informations about log4j exploit ⚠️</title><link>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2021/log4j-dec2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 08:49:44 +0100</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2021/log4j-dec2021/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone! Due to the recent accidents regarding the Java library log4j we would like to inform you, that your mailcow is NOT affected directly by this.
Yes, it is true, that the Solr Container is a Java application which is affected by the log4j security breach. BUT solr is NOT accessible from the outside of the mailcow stack!
For those who are worried we released a Solr Hotfix which is fixing the log4j issue with the simple flag +EXTRA_ARGS+=('-Dlog4j2.</description></item><item><title>mailcows updated between 25th August and 2nd September 2021 should be updated again</title><link>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2021/rspamd_memleak_sep2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 20:19:57 +0100</pubDate><author>André Peters</author><guid>http://news.mailcow.email/posts/2021/rspamd_memleak_sep2021/</guid><description>Hi,
If you updated your mailcow between 25th August and 2nd September 2021 you most likely encounter a settings map memory leak in Rspamd that was fixed just now.
Besides that, we also heavily reduced the map hammering with another change in the map generator.
Update time!
