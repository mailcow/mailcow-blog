<p>As already announced on social media channels, today we are serving you a new edition of our section: <code>What's up?</code>.</p>
<p>Today, we are explicitly discussing a topic of burning interest to all of us: <strong>LDAP/OIDC Integration</strong> and the associated <strong>overhaul of the authentication system</strong>.</p>

Of course, we will also show you how to use the new feature.</description></item><item><title>🐮🤝 LDAP is real and is coming 2023</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/ldap-announcement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 11:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/ldap-announcement/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>
