&lt;p>As already announced on social media channels, today we are serving you a new edition of our section: &lt;code>What's up?&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we are explicitly discussing a topic of burning interest to all of us: &lt;strong>LDAP/OIDC Integration&lt;/strong> and the associated &lt;strong>overhaul of the authentication system&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have kept you updated in the past that we are feverishly working on integrating LDAP and OIDC. After all, this function is not without reason one of the most requested features for mailcow ever – and rightly so!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, our plan was to release this whole thing in the first quarter of 2024 or maybe even around Christmas 2023. As you have noticed, both timelines could not be met&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🔒🔑 External Identity Providers for User authentication</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/mailcow-idp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 10:24:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/mailcow-idp/</guid><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/news/">News</category><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moohoo - Good News, everyone!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Nightly Branch, it is now possible to use an external Identity Provider as an additional authentication source.&lt;br>
mailcow utilizes the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol to authenticate only mailbox users.&lt;br>
To enable this, we have made some changes to the way authentication works.&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what has changed, what we had in mind, and what we plan to add in the future. Of course, we will also show you how to use the new feature.&lt;br>
To make things simpler, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the term &lt;code>IdP&lt;/code> (Identity Provider) throughout this post.&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🐮🤝 LDAP is real and is coming 2023</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/ldap-announcement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 11:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/ldap-announcement/</guid><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/news/">News</category><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moohoo everyone!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
