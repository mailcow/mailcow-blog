I hope you are not tired yet of performing updates.
The 2023-08 Release is here, and it contains some hotfixes for the new Spamhaus DQS feature.
If you are not using Spamhaus DQS and haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced any issues with the 2023-07 update, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to install this update.
As this release only contains hotfixes, there is not much to say about it, except for one thing.</description></item><item><title>üçí üêÑ Mooly Update 2023 (a) - Manageable CORS Settings and UI Improvements</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-07/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 10:48:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-07/</guid><description>2023-07a (Release 31th July 2023)There are some fixes for the 2023-07 update.
