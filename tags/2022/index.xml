To end the chaotic year 2022 in a worthy manner, the time has finally come. The long awaited Bootstrap 5 update is finally here!
As already mentioned in some posts, this update marks only the turning point of the mailcow UI, because the new base (Bootstrap 5) will offer us many new possibilities and scope for new features in the future.
Because of the Bootstrap update the old UI was completely renewed and ported to the new version.</description></item><item><title>üööüêÑ Moovember Update 2022 - Sogo 5.8.0, Rspamd 3.4.0 and PHP 8.1 Update | Revision B</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-11a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>info@servercow.de (Moohoo)</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-11a/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moohoo everyone!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

A small but important update for or against the current SOGo Sieve/mail sending problems is here!
We received countless messages about this and implemented a fix within tis update, which hopefully solves the problem for everyone.
For those who are interested: It&amp;rsquo;s probably related to the IPv6 support introduced in SOGo 5.7.1 and the internal IPv6 connectivity of mailcow¬¥s Docker containers, which triggered connectivity issues with SOGo.
Yeah&amp;hellip; however, this bug should be fixed now.</description></item><item><title>Our new addition: The new mailcow UI (MUH-I) in Bootstrap 5</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>info@servercow.de (Moohoo)</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</guid><description>It took long enough, but here it is finally: The new mailcow UI!

Automatic GitHub actions for building the latest container versions has been set up (currently not used productively).</description></item><item><title>‚òÄÔ∏èüêÑ Mooly Update 2022 - TFA Flow Update | Changelog</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 08:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>info@servercow.de (Moohoo)</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-07/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!

Yesterday we received an important tip about a critical security vulnerability in mailcow (thanks again for that). It affects IMAPSYNC and gives access to administration rights in the mailcow UI and API.
It is strongly recommended to install the update as soon as possible to prevent exploitation.
As always please take a look at the GitHub Release: https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2022-05d
The update does not remove any important functionality from mailcow or IMAPSYNC!</description></item><item><title>üååüêÆ Mooay 2022 Update - The Tag Update | Revision C - Changelog</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 09:22:00 +0200</pubDate><author>info@servercow.de (Moohoo)</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05/</guid><description>2022-05c It¬¥s us again again!
