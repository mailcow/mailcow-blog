To end the chaotic year 2022 in a worthy manner, the time has finally come. The long awaited Bootstrap 5 update is finally here!
As already mentioned in some posts, this update marks only the turning point of the mailcow UI, because the new base (Bootstrap 5) will offer us many new possibilities and scope for new features in the future.
Because of the Bootstrap update the old UI was completely renewed and ported to the new version.</description></item><item><title>🚚🐄 Moovember Update 2022 - Sogo 5.8.0, Rspamd 3.4.0 and PHP 8.1 Update | Revision B</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-11a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-11a/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>

A small but important update for or against the current SOGo Sieve/mail sending problems is here!
We received countless messages about this and implemented a fix within tis update, which hopefully solves the problem for everyone.
For those who are interested: It&amp;rsquo;s probably related to the IPv6 support introduced in SOGo 5.7.1 and the internal IPv6 connectivity of mailcow´s Docker containers, which triggered connectivity issues with SOGo.
Yeah&amp;hellip; however, this bug should be fixed now.</description></item><item><title>Our new addition: The new mailcow UI (MUH-I) in Bootstrap 5</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/demo_thumb.png" alt="Our new addition: The new mailcow UI (MUH-I) in Bootstrap 5" title="Our new addition: The new mailcow UI (MUH-I) in Bootstrap 5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div>It took long enough, but here it is finally: The new mailcow UI!
Currently it&rsquo;s still exclusively in the nightly builds because we want to optimize the UI.
And that&rsquo;s where you come in! Because we want to make the UI as user friendly as possible and improve not only the framework but also the usability.
So if there was one thing that always bothered you so far, please let us know!]]></description></item><item><title>🌊🐄 Amoogust Update 2022 - The Nightly Build Switch Update | Changes</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 10:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!
