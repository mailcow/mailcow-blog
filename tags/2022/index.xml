A small but important update for or against the current SOGo Sieve/mail sending problems is here!
We received countless messages about this and implemented a fix within tis update, which hopefully solves the problem for everyone.
For those who are interested: It&amp;rsquo;s probably related to the IPv6 support introduced in SOGo 5.7.1 and the internal IPv6 connectivity of mailcow¬¥s Docker containers, which triggered connectivity issues with SOGo.
Yeah&amp;hellip; however, this bug should be fixed now.</description></item><item><title>Our new addition: The new mailcow UI (MUH-I) in Bootstrap 5</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

Currently it&rsquo;s still exclusively in the nightly builds because we want to optimize the UI.
And that&rsquo;s where you come in! Because we want to make the UI as user friendly as possible and improve not only the framework but also the usability.
So if there was one thing that always bothered you so far, please let us know!]]></description></item><item><title>üåäüêÑ Amoogust Update 2022 - The Nightly Build Switch Update | Changes</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 10:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!

TFA Changes 2FA is now also possible for mailbox users in the UI (previously this was reserved for administrators). Also, it is now possible to enable multiple 2FA options for an account. Note: Only one is used, which is selected by the user. There is a nice new menu at to select the available 2FA options.</description></item><item><title>üåïüêÑ Moone Update 2022 - The Docker Compose v2 Update (Part I) | Changes</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-06/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 12:07:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-06/</guid><description>Moohoo everybody!

Yesterday we received an important tip about a critical security vulnerability in mailcow (thanks again for that). It affects IMAPSYNC and gives access to administration rights in the mailcow UI and API.
It is strongly recommended to install the update as soon as possible to prevent exploitation.
As always please take a look at the GitHub Release: https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2022-05d
The update does not remove any important functionality from mailcow or IMAPSYNC!</description></item><item><title>üååüêÆ Mooay 2022 Update - The Tag Update | Revision C - Changelog</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 09:22:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05/</guid><description>2022-05c It¬¥s us again again!

2022-05b It¬¥s us again!
Today we have a small API Fix Update which focus mainly on the UI.
As some of you reported the API Calls for Domains/Mailboxes don¬¥t work anymore if there is no Tag set.</description></item><item><title>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Information about the 2022-04 Update ‚ö†Ô∏è</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/2022-04-info/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 10:01:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/2022-04-info/</guid><description>Yesterday we released the 2022-04 update (Moopril) which included a change in the NGINX configuration. During the same day we received a message that SOGo would not work since the update, more precisely the login.
So we released an update yesterday evening around 23:00 (German summertime) which solves this problem in most cases.
Please update your mailcow via the update.sh Script as soon as possible to use SOGo as usual again.</description></item></channel></rss>
