mailcow continues to enjoy increasing popularity, and we are, of course, delighted by this.
To continue delivering the necessary quality in the project and always meet the community&amp;rsquo;s expectations, we have adjusted and extended our update intervals accordingly. This allows us to maintain the high quality of updates for bug and feature requests.
Going forward, we will tie the update intervals to the significance of the scope of the requests.</description></item><item><title>ü§îüîíüêÆ What's up? - LDAP Integration</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/whats-up-ldap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 11:10:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/whats-up-ldap/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>
