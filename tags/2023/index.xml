With the Nightly Branch, it is now possible to use an external Identity Provider as an additional authentication source.
mailcow utilizes the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol to authenticate only mailbox users.
To enable this, we have made some changes to the way authentication works.
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what has changed, what we had in mind, and what we plan to add in the future. Of course, we will also show you how to use the new feature.</description></item><item><title>💪🐮6️⃣4️⃣ mailcow: dockerized (ARM64) is now in open Beta (inside nightly builds)</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-open-beta/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>info@servercow.de (Moohoo)</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-open-beta/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moohoo everyone!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

It has been more than a month since you heard from us and today we have a shadowdrop as an update.
Since we have a few things to discuss and want to communicate directly in the future, we came up with a section called What&amp;rsquo;s up?.
Today we start with the first topic, namely ARM64:
Originally we announced to have mailcow ARM64 ready by June 2023.

It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go:
Changelog For Dovecot, the maildir_very_dirty_syncs option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this.
