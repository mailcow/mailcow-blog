I hope you are not tired yet of performing updates.
The 2023-08 Release is here, and it contains some hotfixes for the new Spamhaus DQS feature.
If you are not using Spamhaus DQS and haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced any issues with the 2023-07 update, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to install this update.
As this release only contains hotfixes, there is not much to say about it, except for one thing.</description></item><item><title>🍒 🐄 Mooly Update 2023 (a) - Manageable CORS Settings and UI Improvements</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-07/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 10:48:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Patrick Schult/FreddleSpl0it</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-07/</guid><description>2023-07a (Release 31th July 2023) There are some fixes for the 2023-07 update.

It has been more than a month since you heard from us and today we have a shadowdrop as an update.
Since we have a few things to discuss and want to communicate directly in the future, we came up with a section called What&amp;rsquo;s up?.
Today we start with the first topic, namely ARM64:
Originally we announced to have mailcow ARM64 ready by June 2023. Obviously that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out so well.</description></item><item><title>🛑📜 Spamhaus DNS Blocklist changes since 2023-07</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/spamhaus-dnsblocklist/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 16:00:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/spamhaus-dnsblocklist/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>

It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go:
Changelog For Dovecot, the maildir_very_dirty_syncs option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this. This describes the exact reasons for the performance boost as well as cases where the feature should be disabled: https://docs.</description></item><item><title>💪🐮 armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-announcement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-announcement/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
