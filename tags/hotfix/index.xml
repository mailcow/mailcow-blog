I hope you are not tired yet of performing updates.
The 2023-08 Release is here, and it contains some hotfixes for the new Spamhaus DQS feature.
If you are not using Spamhaus DQS and haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced any issues with the 2023-07 update, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to install this update.
As this release only contains hotfixes, there is not much to say about it, except for one thing.</description></item><item><title>üå∑üêÑ Mooay Update 2023 - Revision A (‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL security update ‚ö†Ô∏è)</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05a/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05a/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>

<p>We urge you to apply this update as this vulnerability has been lurking in the code for quite some time (before 2020).</p>]]></description></item><item><title>‚ö†Ô∏è 2022-05d Important Security Update! ‚ö†Ô∏è</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05d/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 16:03:56 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-05d/</guid><description>Hello all,
Yesterday we received an important tip about a critical security vulnerability in mailcow (thanks again for that). It affects IMAPSYNC and gives access to administration rights in the mailcow UI and API.
It is strongly recommended to install the update as soon as possible to prevent exploitation.
As always please take a look at the GitHub Release: https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2022-05d
The update does not remove any important functionality from mailcow or IMAPSYNC!</description></item><item><title>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Information about the 2022-04 Update ‚ö†Ô∏è</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/2022-04-info/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 10:01:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/2022-04-info/</guid><description>Yesterday we released the 2022-04 update (Moopril) which included a change in the NGINX configuration. During the same day we received a message that SOGo would not work since the update, more precisely the login.
So we released an update yesterday evening around 23:00 (German summertime) which solves this problem in most cases.
Please update your mailcow via the update.sh Script as soon as possible to use SOGo as usual again.</description></item></channel></rss>
