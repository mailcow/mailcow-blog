<li>
<p>We have downgraded the containers affected by a cURL submodule bug (phpfpm, unbound, watchdog &amp; acme) in their Alpine version from 3.19 to 3.18. This should eliminate the need for the workaround (<a href="https://twitter.com/mailcow_email/status/1747880630317101556"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">see</a>). We will (probably) revert to Alpine 3.19 in these containers in the 2024-02 update (assuming the bug is fixed then)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is now possible to deactivate or skip the unbound health checks. Background (primary) is the geo blocking of some countries (e.g. China) which prohibit access via DNS to GitHub, but the check is based on it. A new mailcow variable was set for this (<code>SKIP_UNBOUND_HEALTHCHECK</code>)</p>

It has been more than a month since you heard from us and today we have a shadowdrop as an update.
Since we have a few things to discuss and want to communicate directly in the future, we came up with a section called What&amp;rsquo;s up?.
Today we start with the first topic, namely ARM64:
Originally we announced to have mailcow ARM64 ready by June 2023. Obviously that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out so well.</description></item><item><title>üå∑üêÑ Mooai Update 2023 - IMAP Performance + general Tweaks Update</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!
It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go:
Changelog For Dovecot, the maildir_very_dirty_syncs option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this. This describes the exact reasons for the performance boost as well as cases where the feature should be disabled: https://docs.</description></item><item><title>üí™üêÆ armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-announcement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-announcement/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/2023/May/arm64_announcement.jpg" alt="üí™üêÆ armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement" title="üí™üêÆ armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div><p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>
<p>The emerging hype about ARM64 has not left the mailcow team cold either and so it is a pleasure to say:</p>
