It has been more than a month since you heard from us and today we have a shadowdrop as an update.
Since we have a few things to discuss and want to communicate directly in the future, we came up with a section called What&amp;rsquo;s up?.
Today we start with the first topic, namely ARM64:
Originally we announced to have mailcow ARM64 ready by June 2023. Obviously that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out so well.</description></item><item><title>🌷🐄 Mooai Update 2023 - IMAP Performance + general Tweaks Update</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!
It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go:
Changelog For Dovecot, the maildir_very_dirty_syncs option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this. This describes the exact reasons for the performance boost as well as cases where the feature should be disabled: https://docs.</description></item><item><title>💪🐮 armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-announcement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-announcement/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/2023/May/arm64_announcement.jpg" alt="💪🐮 armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement" title="💪🐮 armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div><p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>
<p>The emerging hype about ARM64 has not left the mailcow team cold either and so it is a pleasure to say:</p>
