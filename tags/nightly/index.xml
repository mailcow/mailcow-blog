&lt;p>In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the current state of the nightly branch of mailcow. The biggest highlight is of course the support for external authentication sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make this new feature as seamless and user-friendly as possible, we had to introduce some adjustments — you&amp;rsquo;ll see what I mean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But first, a huge thank you to everyone in the community who tested the nightly branch and provided valuable feedback. 🙌 At this point, most of the work is done, and we&amp;rsquo;re only expecting small bug fixes if needed. Some users have already adopted the nightly branch in production and are happy with it — which is fantastic!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🔒🔑 External Identity Providers for User authentication</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/mailcow-idp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 10:24:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/mailcow-idp/</guid><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/news/">News</category><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moohoo - Good News, everyone!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Nightly Branch, it is now possible to use an external Identity Provider as an additional authentication source.&lt;br>
mailcow utilizes the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol to authenticate only mailbox users.&lt;br>
To enable this, we have made some changes to the way authentication works.&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what has changed, what we had in mind, and what we plan to add in the future. Of course, we will also show you how to use the new feature.&lt;br>
To make things simpler, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the term &lt;code>IdP&lt;/code> (Identity Provider) throughout this post.&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our new addition: The new mailcow UI (MUH-I) in Bootstrap 5</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</guid><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/nightly/">Nightly</category><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/beta/">Beta</category><description>&lt;p>It took long enough, but here it is finally: The new mailcow UI!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently it&amp;rsquo;s still exclusively in the nightly builds because we want to optimize the UI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s where you come in! Because we want to make the UI as user friendly as possible and improve not only the framework but also the usability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if there was one thing that always bothered you so far, please let us know!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
