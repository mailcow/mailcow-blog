With the Nightly Branch, it is now possible to use an external Identity Provider as an additional authentication source.
mailcow utilizes the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol to authenticate only mailbox users.
To enable this, we have made some changes to the way authentication works.
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what has changed, what we had in mind, and what we plan to add in the future. Of course, we will also show you how to use the new feature.</description></item><item><title>Our new addition: The new mailcow UI (MUH-I) in Bootstrap 5</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/nightly-tests-bs5/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/demo_thumb.png" alt="Our new addition: The new mailcow UI (MUH-I) in Bootstrap 5" title="Our new addition: The new mailcow UI (MUH-I) in Bootstrap 5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div>It took long enough, but here it is finally: The new mailcow UI!
Currently it&rsquo;s still exclusively in the nightly builds because we want to optimize the UI.
And that&rsquo;s where you come in! Because we want to make the UI as user friendly as possible and improve not only the framework but also the usability.
So if there was one thing that always bothered you so far, please let us know!]]></description></item></channel></rss>
