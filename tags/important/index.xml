Yesterday we received an important tip about a critical security vulnerability in mailcow (thanks again for that). It affects IMAPSYNC and gives access to administration rights in the mailcow UI and API.
It is strongly recommended to install the update as soon as possible to prevent exploitation.
As always please take a look at the GitHub Release: https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2022-05d
The update does not remove any important functionality from mailcow or IMAPSYNC!</description></item><item><title>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Information about the 2022-04 Update ‚ö†Ô∏è</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/2022-04-info/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 10:01:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/2022-04-info/</guid><description>Yesterday we released the 2022-04 update (Moopril) which included a change in the NGINX configuration. During the same day we received a message that SOGo would not work since the update, more precisely the login.
So we released an update yesterday evening around 23:00 (German summertime) which solves this problem in most cases.
Please update your mailcow via the update.sh Script as soon as possible to use SOGo as usual again.</description></item></channel></rss>
