It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go:
Changelog For Dovecot, the maildir_very_dirty_syncs option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this. This describes the exact reasons for the performance boost as well as cases where the feature should be disabled: https://docs.</description></item></channel></rss>
