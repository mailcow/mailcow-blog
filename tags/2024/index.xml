<p>As already announced on social media channels, today we are serving you a new edition of our section: <code>What's up?</code>.</p>
<p>Today, we are explicitly discussing a topic of burning interest to all of us: <strong>LDAP/OIDC Integration</strong> and the associated <strong>overhaul of the authentication system</strong>.</p>
<p>We have kept you updated in the past that we are feverishly working on integrating LDAP and OIDC. After all, this function is not without reason one of the most requested features for mailcow ever – and rightly so!</p>

With Febmooary, further recently released security vulnerabilities in mailcow have been addressed. These are the following security vulnerabilities in the ClamAV service that were fixed with version 1.2.2:
CVE-2024-20290: Fixed a possible heap overflow read bug in the OLE2 file parser that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. CVE-2024-20328: Fixed a possible command injection vulnerability in the &amp;ldquo;VirusEvent&amp;rdquo; feature of ClamAV&amp;rsquo;s ClamD service. In the default configuration, mailcow is not affected by the CVE-2024-20328 vulnerability, as the VirusEvent in the ClamAV configuration is not activated.</description></item><item><title>🦾6️⃣4️⃣ 🐄 Janmooary 2024 Update | The Multiarch (x86 + ARM64) &amp; Performance Update - Revision E</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/release-2024-01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 11:19:02 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/release-2024-01/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/2024/January/release-arm64.jpg" alt="🦾6️⃣4️⃣ 🐄 Janmooary 2024 Update | The Multiarch (x86 &#43; ARM64) &amp; Performance Update - Revision E" title="🦾6️⃣4️⃣ 🐄 Janmooary 2024 Update | The Multiarch (x86 &#43; ARM64) &amp; Performance Update - Revision E" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div>2024-01e (Release: 08th Februars 2024)Netfilter Enhancements
