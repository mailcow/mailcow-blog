<li>
<p>We have downgraded the containers affected by a cURL submodule bug (phpfpm, unbound, watchdog &amp; acme) in their Alpine version from 3.19 to 3.18. This should eliminate the need for the workaround (<a href="https://twitter.com/mailcow_email/status/1747880630317101556"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">see</a>). We will (probably) revert to Alpine 3.19 in these containers in the 2024-02 update (assuming the bug is fixed then)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is now possible to deactivate or skip the unbound health checks. Background (primary) is the geo blocking of some countries (e.g. China) which prohibit access via DNS to GitHub, but the check is based on it. A new mailcow variable was set for this (<code>SKIP_UNBOUND_HEALTHCHECK</code>)</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that affected the watchdog webhooks, which caused the webhooks not to be formatted correctly and no information was displayed on the respective platform.</p>

<li>The timeout for the unbound health check has been increased from 10 to 30 seconds. On some systems, the extended checks resulted in an unhealthy status even though they were OK.</li>
