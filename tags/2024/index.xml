  <a href="#other-changes" class="heading-mark"></a>Other Changes</h3><ul>
<li>Fixed issues with parsing the Docker version number in the <code>generate-config.sh</code> and <code>update.sh</code> scripts.</li>
<li>Some Dockerfiles were refactored (this has no impact on operations, it only serves for future development).</li>
<li>An exit condition was added to Dovecot concerning the download of sa-rules. Previously, the download had to be successful; otherwise, Dovecot would not start. Now, if the download fails after several attempts, Dovecot will still start.</li>
<li>In Docker containers that used the <code>mysqladmin</code> tool, the tool has been replaced with the newer <code>mariadb-admin</code> with the same functionality to prevent future compatibility issues.</li>
<li>Several Bash variables in the scripts are now handled correctly (quoting), and some strange non-UTF-8 characters have been replaced.</li>
<li>Due to the Rspamd update to 3.9.1, UTF-8 decoding in the Pushover and quarantine systems was broken, which could have led to unexpected results when emojis were in the header. This has been fixed.</li>

<li>After some back and forth (sorry about that&hellip;), we have decided to keep the affected PHP container on a working version (yes, there was one :D) until we can confirm through deeper tests that it finally works with a patched Alpine&hellip; until then, the container will remain &ldquo;frozen.&rdquo; The new container caused Roundcube users to experience issues, mainly due to permissions. Since we cannot rule out that this might break more third-party apps, we have reverted the version.</li>
<li>We fixed an error in the UI where the version modal was not opening correctly. Although it did open, it redirected you to the release page directly, making the modal unnecessary&hellip;</li>

<li>Improved regular expression in the backup/restore script, it should now support numbers like 10, 20, etc.</li>
<li>The PHP container has been built based on Debian 12. This should (please&hellip; the bug is really annoying&hellip;) finally fix the issues some of you had regarding blank mailcow UI or incorrect container values within the UI (etc.). We are still working on identifying the problem in the Alpine container so that we can use the Alpine base again in the long term (due to the smaller container size).</li>
<li>The WIP warning for ARM64 versions has been removed from the web UI. It is now (actually from the beginning&hellip;) stable! Thanks to everyone using it!</li>
<li>Postfix&rsquo;s Postscreen access list has been updated as of July 1, 2024.</li>

At the same time, this update requires communication between SMTP servers to use at least TLS version 1.2.
This means we are discontinuing support for the older TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>üåü Important News on the Continued Development of mailcow</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/development-change/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 16:00:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/development-change/</guid><description>Dear mailcow Community,

<p>As already announced on social media channels, today we are serving you a new edition of our section: <code>What's up?</code>.</p>
<p>Today, we are explicitly discussing a topic of burning interest to all of us: <strong>LDAP/OIDC Integration</strong> and the associated <strong>overhaul of the authentication system</strong>.</p>
<p>We have kept you updated in the past that we are feverishly working on integrating LDAP and OIDC. After all, this function is not without reason one of the most requested features for mailcow ever ‚Äì and rightly so!</p>
<p>However, our plan was to release this whole thing in the first quarter of 2024 or maybe even around Christmas 2023.

With Febmooary, further recently released security vulnerabilities in mailcow have been addressed. These are the following security vulnerabilities in the ClamAV service that were fixed with version 1.2.2:
CVE-2024-20290: Fixed a possible heap overflow read bug in the OLE2 file parser that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. CVE-2024-20328: Fixed a possible command injection vulnerability in the &amp;ldquo;VirusEvent&amp;rdquo; feature of ClamAV&amp;rsquo;s ClamD service. In the default configuration, mailcow is not affected by the CVE-2024-20328 vulnerability, as the VirusEvent in the ClamAV configuration is not activated.</description></item><item><title>ü¶æ6Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ üêÑ Janmooary 2024 Update | The Multiarch (x86 + ARM64) &amp; Performance Update - Revision E</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/release-2024-01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 11:19:02 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/release-2024-01/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/2024/January/release-arm64.jpg" alt="ü¶æ6Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ üêÑ Janmooary 2024 Update | The Multiarch (x86 &#43; ARM64) &amp; Performance Update - Revision E" title="ü¶æ6Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ üêÑ Janmooary 2024 Update | The Multiarch (x86 &#43; ARM64) &amp; Performance Update - Revision E" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div>2024-01e (Release: 08th Februars 2024)Netfilter Enhancements
