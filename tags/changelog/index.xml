A small but important update for or against the current SOGo Sieve/mail sending problems is here!
We received countless messages about this and implemented a fix within tis update, which hopefully solves the problem for everyone.
For those who are interested: It&amp;rsquo;s probably related to the IPv6 support introduced in SOGo 5.7.1 and the internal IPv6 connectivity of mailcow´s Docker containers, which triggered connectivity issues with SOGo.
Yeah&amp;hellip; however, this bug should be fixed now.</description></item><item><title>🌊🐄 Amoogust Update 2022 - The Nightly Build Switch Update | Changes</title><link>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 10:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://news.mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-08/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!
