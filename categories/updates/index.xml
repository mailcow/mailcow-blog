I hope you are not tired yet of performing updates.
The 2023-08 Release is here, and it contains some hotfixes for the new Spamhaus DQS feature.
If you are not using Spamhaus DQS and haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced any issues with the 2023-07 update, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to install this update.
As this release only contains hotfixes, there is not much to say about it, except for one thing.</description></item><item><title>🍒 🐄 Mooly Update 2023 (a) - Manageable CORS Settings and UI Improvements</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-07/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 10:48:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Patrick Schult/FreddleSpl0it</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-07/</guid><description>2023-07a (Release 31th July 2023) There are some fixes for the 2023-07 update.

It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go:
Changelog For Dovecot, the maildir_very_dirty_syncs option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this. This describes the exact reasons for the performance boost as well as cases where the feature should be disabled: https://docs.</description></item><item><title>🥚🐄 Moopril Update 2023 - SOGo 5.8.2, Rspamd 3.5 and more | Revision A</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-04/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

The mailcow team is back with some exciting news about our beloved mailcow project!
But this time we are doing something a bit different than usual (at least here with the blog post entry)
As you may have noticed in the last few weeks, a new AI has been making the rounds on the Internet: ChatGPT.

Because of the Bootstrap update the old UI was completely renewed and ported to the new version.</description></item><item><title>🚚🐄 Moovember Update 2022 - Sogo 5.8.0, Rspamd 3.4.0 and PHP 8.1 Update | Revision B</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-11a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-11a/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>
