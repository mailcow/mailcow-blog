Important Before updating mailcow, make sure that the whois package is installed on your system.
New Feature: Manage CORS Settings administrators can now manage CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings via the web UI for API access. This allows for better control and enhanced security when handling data exchange between different origins.
CORS - Why Is It Needed? Under normal circumstances, when a script runs in the user&amp;rsquo;s browser, it primarily needs to access resources from the same origin.</description></item><item><title>🌷🐄 Mooay Update 2023 - Revision A (⚠️ CRITICAL security update ⚠️)</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05a/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05a/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>
<p>A very urgent security update for mailcow (2023-05a) has just been released.</p>
<p>We urge you to apply this update as this vulnerability has been lurking in the code for quite some time (before 2020).</p>]]></description></item><item><title>🌷🐄 Mooai Update 2023 - IMAP Performance + general Tweaks Update</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!
It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go:
Changelog For Dovecot, the maildir_very_dirty_syncs option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this. This describes the exact reasons for the performance boost as well as cases where the feature should be disabled: https://docs.</description></item><item><title>🥚🐄 Moopril Update 2023 - SOGo 5.8.2, Rspamd 3.5 and more | Revision A</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-04/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

The mailcow team is back with some exciting news about our beloved mailcow project!
But this time we are doing something a bit different than usual (at least here with the blog post entry)
As you may have noticed in the last few weeks, a new AI has been making the rounds on the Internet: ChatGPT.
So we thought: &amp;ldquo;Hey, why don&amp;rsquo;t we let the bot write our changelog in text form?</description></item><item><title>🎄🐄 Moocember Update 2022 - MUH-I Update (Bootstrap 5)</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-12/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-12/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Introduction Moohoo everyone!
To end the chaotic year 2022 in a worthy manner, the time has finally come. The long awaited Bootstrap 5 update is finally here!
As already mentioned in some posts, this update marks only the turning point of the mailcow UI, because the new base (Bootstrap 5) will offer us many new possibilities and scope for new features in the future.
Because of the Bootstrap update the old UI was completely renewed and ported to the new version.</description></item><item><title>🚚🐄 Moovember Update 2022 - Sogo 5.8.0, Rspamd 3.4.0 and PHP 8.1 Update | Revision B</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-11a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2022/release-2022-11a/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>
