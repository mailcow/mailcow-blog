It&amp;rsquo;s Friday then Then Saturday, Sunday (what?)
We have an exciting news to share with you!
We present you the newly released mailcow: dockerized Docs 2.0!
Not much may have changed at first glance (you would think) but under the hood a lot has changed!
So we present you from today:
Multi-language support (English and German are supported and updated by Servercow itself ) Light-/Darkmode New organized structure (interesting for contributors) All in all a remake of the existing docs.</description></item></channel></rss>
