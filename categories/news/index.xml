&lt;p>mailcow continues to enjoy increasing popularity, and we are, of course, delighted by this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To continue delivering the necessary quality in the project and always meet the community&amp;rsquo;s expectations, we have adjusted and extended our update intervals accordingly. This allows us to maintain the high quality of updates for bug and feature requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Going forward, we will tie the update intervals to the significance of the scope of the requests. Security fixes will remain an exception and will continue to be released as quickly as possible to ensure the security and stability of your installations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🤔🔒🐮 What's up? - LDAP Integration</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/whats-up-ldap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 11:10:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/whats-up-ldap/</guid><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/whats-up/">What's Up?</category><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/news/">News</category><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moohoo everyone!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As already announced on social media channels, today we are serving you a new edition of our section: &lt;code>What's up?&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we are explicitly discussing a topic of burning interest to all of us: &lt;strong>LDAP/OIDC Integration&lt;/strong> and the associated &lt;strong>overhaul of the authentication system&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have kept you updated in the past that we are feverishly working on integrating LDAP and OIDC. After all, this function is not without reason one of the most requested features for mailcow ever – and rightly so!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, our plan was to release this whole thing in the first quarter of 2024 or maybe even around Christmas 2023. As you have noticed, both timelines could not be met&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>💪🐮6️⃣4️⃣ mailcow: dockerized (ARM64) development stagnates.

&lt;p>We are back with new information on the current ARM64 topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s not good news, as you might have guessed from the headline&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🔒🔑 External Identity Providers for User authentication</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/mailcow-idp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 10:24:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/mailcow-idp/</guid><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/news/">News</category><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moohoo - Good News, everyone!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Nightly Branch, it is now possible to use an external Identity Provider as an additional authentication source.&lt;br>
mailcow utilizes the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol to authenticate only mailbox users.&lt;br>
To enable this, we have made some changes to the way authentication works.&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what has changed, what we had in mind, and what we plan to add in the future. Of course, we will also show you how to use the new feature.&lt;br>
To make things simpler, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the term &lt;code>IdP&lt;/code> (Identity Provider) throughout this post.&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>💪🐮6️⃣4️⃣ mailcow: dockerized (ARM64) is now in open Beta (inside nightly builds)</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-open-beta/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-open-beta/</guid><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/news/">News</category><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moohoo everyone!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No you are not dreaming, yes you are awake and no this is no joke:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>mailcow&amp;rsquo;s ARM64 support can now be tested in nightly as &lt;strong>BETA&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🤔🐮 What's up? - ARM64 Integration</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/whats-up-arm64/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 09:15:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/whats-up-arm64/</guid><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/whats-up/">What's Up?</category><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/news/">News</category><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moohoo everyone!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been more than a month since you heard from us and today we have a shadowdrop as an update.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we have a few things to discuss and want to communicate directly in the future, we came up with a section called &lt;strong>What&amp;rsquo;s up?&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we start with the first topic, namely &lt;strong>ARM64&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally we announced to have mailcow ARM64 ready by June 2023. Obviously that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out so well. However, we still want to provide it and are still working on it. However, there are some difficulties to make a smooth transition from mailcow to ARM64.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🌷🐄 Mooai Update 2023 - IMAP Performance + general Tweaks Update</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</guid><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/updates/">Updates</category><category domain="https://mailcow.email/categories/news/">News</category><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moohoo everyone!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s go:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="changelog" class="heading-element">&lt;span>Changelog&lt;/span>
 &lt;a href="#changelog" class="heading-mark">

 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For Dovecot, the &lt;code>maildir_very_dirty_syncs&lt;/code> option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this. This describes the exact reasons for the performance boost as well as cases where the feature should be disabled: &lt;a href="https://docs.mailcow.email/manual-guides/Dovecot/u_e-dovecot-performance"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://docs.mailcow.email/manual-guides/Dovecot/u_e-dovecot-performance&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed a bug in the BCC Map setting in the UI, this messed up the dropdown once a selection was made. Also, it was not possible to select aliases as a local target.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the user view (Spam Aliases) the aliases were displayed in the wrong order, this has been fixed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A problem in the Rspamd table (especially on devices with smaller screens) caused display errors in the user interface. For example, the spam value and scan time were not displayed. This is now fixed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the user view, the tabs displayed now match the ACLs set.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When clicking on &amp;ldquo;Show user&amp;rsquo;s active filters&amp;rdquo; in the user view, an error message was displayed instead of the set Sieve filters. From now on, the user&amp;rsquo;s active Sieve filters are displayed here as expected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A display error where a deleted mailbox (from which it was possible to send as another mailbox) was still displayed in the &amp;ldquo;Send as&amp;rdquo; drop-down list has been fixed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An automatic update of the accesslist for postscreen has been set up for Postfix via GitHub. This automatically updates the list every month (then rolled out with new updates from mailcow).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Old SASL logs were not correctly removed from the database. This is now the case.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The UI now shows the architecture used under the hostname of your mailcow instance. This is in preparation for ARM64 support (see below for current status).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some typos and links have been corrected.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As always, the full changelog with the individual commits is available on GitHub:

&lt;p>First of all, a big, big sorry for the long radio silence here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have not forgotten the blog here and will also fill this again with content, probably once a month as a summary of what has happened with the updates, which now (actually) come more spontaneously and more often and with more innovations instead of &amp;ldquo;ONLY&amp;rdquo; bug fixes, etc..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in this blogpost we would like to draw your attention to a mysterious thing:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
