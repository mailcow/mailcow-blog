mailcow continues to enjoy increasing popularity, and we are, of course, delighted by this.
To continue delivering the necessary quality in the project and always meet the community&amp;rsquo;s expectations, we have adjusted and extended our update intervals accordingly. This allows us to maintain the high quality of updates for bug and feature requests.
Going forward, we will tie the update intervals to the significance of the scope of the requests.</description></item><item><title>🤔🔒🐮 What's up? - LDAP Integration</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/whats-up-ldap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 11:10:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/whats-up-ldap/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>
<p>As already announced on social media channels, today we are serving you a new edition of our section: <code>What's up?</code>.</p>
<p>Today, we are explicitly discussing a topic of burning interest to all of us: <strong>LDAP/OIDC Integration</strong> and the associated <strong>overhaul of the authentication system</strong>.</p>
<p>We have kept you updated in the past that we are feverishly working on integrating LDAP and OIDC. After all, this function is not without reason one of the most requested features for mailcow ever – and rightly so!</p>
<p>However, our plan was to release this whole thing in the first quarter of 2024 or maybe even around Christmas 2023. As you have noticed, both timelines could not be met&hellip;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>💪🐮6️⃣4️⃣ mailcow: dockerized (ARM64) development stagnates.

<p>We are back with new information on the current ARM64 topic.</p>

With the Nightly Branch, it is now possible to use an external Identity Provider as an additional authentication source.
mailcow utilizes the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol to authenticate only mailbox users.
To enable this, we have made some changes to the way authentication works.
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what has changed, what we had in mind, and what we plan to add in the future. Of course, we will also show you how to use the new feature.</description></item><item><title>💪🐮6️⃣4️⃣ mailcow: dockerized (ARM64) is now in open Beta (inside nightly builds)</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-open-beta/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-open-beta/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>

It has been more than a month since you heard from us and today we have a shadowdrop as an update.
Since we have a few things to discuss and want to communicate directly in the future, we came up with a section called What&amp;rsquo;s up?.
Today we start with the first topic, namely ARM64:
Originally we announced to have mailcow ARM64 ready by June 2023. Obviously that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out so well.</description></item><item><title>🌷🐄 Mooai Update 2023 - IMAP Performance + general Tweaks Update</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!
It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go:
Changelog For Dovecot, the maildir_very_dirty_syncs option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this. This describes the exact reasons for the performance boost as well as cases where the feature should be disabled: https://docs.</description></item><item><title>💪🐮 armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-announcement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-announcement/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/2023/May/arm64_announcement.jpg" alt="💪🐮 armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement" title="💪🐮 armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div><p><strong>Moohoo everyone!</strong></p>

First of all, a big, big sorry for the long radio silence here.
We have not forgotten the blog here and will also fill this again with content, probably once a month as a summary of what has happened with the updates, which now (actually) come more spontaneously and more often and with more innovations instead of &ldquo;ONLY&rdquo; bug fixes, etc..
But in this blogpost we would like to draw your attention to a mysterious thing:]]></description></item></channel></rss>
