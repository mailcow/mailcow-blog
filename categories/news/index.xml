More than a month we have not heard from us and today just like that a shadowdrop as an update.
Since we have some things to discuss and also want to communicate directly in the future, we have come up with a section that we call What&amp;rsquo;s up?.
Today we start directly with the first topic, namely ARM64:
We had originally announced to make mailcow ARM64 ready by June 2023.</description></item><item><title>🌷🐄 Mooai Update 2023 - IMAP Performance + general Tweaks Update</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 09:30:10 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/release-2023-05/</guid><description>Moohoo everyone!
It&amp;rsquo;s on with our updates for mailcow, this time (once again) mainly to improve the overall stability and usability of the stack, but also to improve IMAP performance.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go:
Changelog For Dovecot, the maildir_very_dirty_syncs option has been enabled by default. This allows much faster IMAP retrieval than before. In the mailcow docs we have created a new page about this. This describes the exact reasons for the performance boost as well as cases where the feature should be disabled: https://docs.</description></item><item><title>💪🐮 armcow64: dockerized (mailcow on ARM64) Announcement</title><link>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-announcement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Niklas Meyer/DerLinkman</author><guid>https://mailcow.email/posts/2023/arm64-announcement/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

First of all, a big, big sorry for the long radio silence here.
We have not forgotten the blog here and will also fill this again with content, probably once a month as a summary of what has happened with the updates, which now (actually) come more spontaneously and more often and with more innovations instead of &ldquo;ONLY&rdquo; bug fixes, etc..
But in this blogpost we would like to draw your attention to a mysterious thing:]]></description></item></channel></rss>
