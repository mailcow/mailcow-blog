It´s finally time: Our new mailcow Demos are here and live for you to test!
What does that mean now?
Well, a few of you might be interested to test out our new features located in the nightly builds but don´t have a chance to setup a special tesing environment or simply doesn´t want to.
And that´s where the new nightly demo instance takes place. This one is the newly created demo which features all changes from the nightly builds directly installed from GitHub.</description></item></channel></rss>
