## 2023-08  (Release 3rd August 2023)

**Moohoo everyone!**

I hope you are not tired yet of performing updates.<br>
The 2023-08 Release is here, and it contains some hotfixes for the new Spamhaus DQS feature.<br>
**If you are not using Spamhaus DQS and haven't experienced any issues with the 2023-07 update, you don't have to install this update.**<br>

As this release only contains hotfixes, there is not much to say about it, except for one thing.<br>
If you don't want to use Postscreen DNSBL at all, you can delete and leave **the content** of the file `data/conf/postfix/dns_blocklists.cf` empty.<br>
To undo any changes to this file, simply delete **the file** and restart Postfix.<br>


### Changelog

- Fix main.cf merging order
- [Postfix] rework dns_blocklists.cf generation
- Add postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map to avoid disclosure of DQS key

The full changelog with the individual commits is available on GitHub:
