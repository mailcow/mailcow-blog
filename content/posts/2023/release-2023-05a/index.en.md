**Moohoo everyone!**

A very urgent security update for mailcow (2023-05a) has just been released.

We urge you to apply this update as this vulnerability has been lurking in the code for quite some time (before 2020).

<!--more-->

Roughly speaking, this vulnerability is a password parsing bug on the part of Dovecot and mailcow.

More detailed information as well as a proof of concept will be available in a **CVE** in the next few days.

There is **NO** workaround for this problem!

### Changelog

- The Nextcloud script now installs Nextcloud 26.0.2 or updates to it (if desired).
- A critical vulnerability in Dovecot was closed, which allowed unauthorized access to another mailbox via a password change. A separate CVE and POC will follow in a few days.
- In the Dockerfiles the maintainer was changed from André to tinc (The Infrastructure Company GmbH).

As always, the full changelog with the individual commits is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2023-05a
