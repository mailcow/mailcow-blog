## 2023-07 (Release 28th July 2023)

**Moohoo everyone!**

### Important
~~Before updating mailcow, make sure that the `whois` package is installed on your system.~~ <br>
A functionality has been added which makes the locally installed package `whois` obsolete.

### New Feature: Manage CORS Settings
administrators can now manage CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings via the web UI for API access. 
This allows for better control and enhanced security when handling data exchange between different origins.

#### CORS - Why Is It Needed?
Under normal circumstances, when a script runs in the user's browser, it primarily needs to access resources from the same origin. 
For example, making API calls to the backend that served the JavaScript code initially. 
This limitation of JavaScript not being able to access resources from other origins is actually a security feature.

"Other origins" in this context refers to URLs that differ from the location where the JavaScript is running. These differences may include having different domain, port or scheme (HTTP or HTTPS).
While this security measure is essential for protecting users from unauthorized access to their data, there are valid situations where cross-origin access becomes necessary or desirable.


### Broadcasting commands to multiple dockerapi instances!
For Administrators who use mailcow in a cluster, you now need to set the following in mailcow.conf: `CLUSTERMODE=replication`.
This ensures, that now on mailbox deletion the request will be broadcasted to each Dockerapi container and therefore each Dovecot container, so all files on each Host will be deleted.


**Bug fixes, Bug fixes and more Bug fixes...**
